KG_and_LLM
A research project aimed at investigating the functioning of knowledge graphs and their combined utilization with language models.

The growing popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to new areas of work and research. One such area is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), which allows models to connect with memory and work with new facts not covered during training.

At present, RAGs are in the early stages of development, and one of the promising foundations for RAG is knowledge graphs (KGs). Our research will delve into how we can integrate LLMs and KGs to build a prospective RAG.

Initially, our concept was to construct a RAG based on knowledge graphs for construction documentation. However, as we recognized the potential, our focus shifted towards a more research-oriented approach. We began an in-depth review of literature and scientific resources related to the construction of knowledge graphs and RAG.

It's difficult to say whether it should be used in our work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

After two months of studying knowledge graphs and scientific articles, we have come to the conclusion that it would be valuable to build a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) model based on knowledge graphs. We plan to compare it to a conventional RAG model using vector-based approaches and potentially encapsulate this research into either a library or a scientific paper.

Among the current tasks:

Dataset Generation and Compilation for RAG
Unfortunately, a sufficiently acceptable dataset for RAG has not yet been gathered, so we will need to develop it ourselves.

Metric Definition for RAG

Testing RAG in various formats, including Text-To-Cypher and Semantic Search over Graph.
